GLMap (https://github.com/olofsj/GLMap/) by olofsj 
- porting of jni part to java and bugs by me
- note: this is just a rough prototype, nothing for users. maybe it is useful as a 
  starting point for how to draw maps with GLES20 on Android. 

'project' folder should be importable 'as existing project' into eclipse

you might need to run 'android update project --path . --target android-xx --subprojects' 
in project folder when using android version 'xx'

- installation:
cd project
ant debug
adb install bin/GLMapActivity-debug.apk

- some tiles to start with:
cd tiles
tar xjf ../map.tar.bz2
cd ..
adb shell mkdir /sdcard/GLMap
adb push tiles /sdcard/GLMap/

compile 'mapgenerator' for creating your own tiles. Bremen is hardcoded origin in  
mapgenerator.c
double center_x = 1991418.0;
double center_y = 8267328.0;

and GLMapRenderer.java
private float xPos = 980073.56f;
private float yPos = 6996566.0f;

It probably works to set the center lat/lon of your map in mapgenerator.c and same in 
MapRenderer. I cant recall how I came up with these values
